This is my undergraduate thesis, which primarily focuses on statistical methodologies for combining historical controls in clinical trial designs.

To be more specific, I provide a comprehensive comparison between frequentist methods and the Bayesian genre, including GLMMs and Bayesian hierarchical modeling. For frequentist methods, we compare different types of meta-analyses and GLMMs using likelihood approximation methods (Penalized Quasi-Likelihood and Laplace approximation methods). For Bayesian methods, I compare various priors, including traditional noninformative priors, traditional power priors, normalized power priors, and commensurate power priors. 

In this repository, I present R, Stan, and BUGS code to complement this work from scratch. Additionally, I conduct an empirical research study based on a Phase II clinical trial and complete a simulation study. Due to data sensitivity concerns, all source data have been excluded. Furthermore, you can find my defense slides in the "document" folder.

If you find it helpful or interesting, feel free to give it a star:) 

Thanks!
